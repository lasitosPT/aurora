# Changelog

## 0.10.0

Product UI batch.

- `aurora-menu` — animated, accessible dropdown: child `<button>`s as items (`data-value`,
  `<hr>` separators), arrow-key roving, Home/End, Escape-with-focus-restore, outside-click
  close, `align="end"`; emits `aurora-select`
- `aurora-compare` — before/after slider: `slot="before"` / `slot="after"`, draggable
  divider with a keyboard-accessible handle (`role="slider"`); emits `aurora-change`
- `aurora-flip` — 3D flip card: `slot="front"` / `slot="back"`, `trigger="hover|click|manual"`,
  `flip()`; emits `aurora-flip`
- `aurora-skeleton` — shimmer loading placeholder: block, `circle`, or `lines="n"`
- `aurora-confetti` — celebration cannon on a full-viewport 2D canvas:
  `AuroraConfetti.burst({ x, y, count, colors })`; gravity, drag and spin; self-stopping;
  no-op under `prefers-reduced-motion`

## 0.9.0

Motion utilities batch + toast redesign.

- `aurora-toaster` redesigned: glassmorphic panels with a tinted glow per variant,
  self-drawing icon badges, an optional `title`, and a progress hairline that _is_ the
  timer — hovering pauses both; dismissal now collapses the toast so the stack reflows
- `aurora-carousel` — drag/swipe carousel with GSAP inertia and slide snapping,
  arrow-key support and `next()`/`prev()`/`goTo(i)`; emits `aurora-slide-change`
- `aurora-orbit` — children revolve around optional `slot="center"` content
  (`radius`, `speed`, `reverse`)
- `aurora-glitch` — RGB-split, slice-clipped glitch burst on scroll into view and on
  hover (`hover`, `play()`, `--aurora-glitch-a/-b`)
- `aurora-progress` — fixed scroll-progress hairline for the top of the page

## 0.8.0

Interaction batch.

- `aurora-toaster` — animated toast stack: `show(message, { variant, duration })` on an
  element you place, or `AuroraToaster.show(...)` to use a shared auto-created one;
  toasts spring in, pause their timer on hover, dismiss on click; `position` attribute
  for the four corners; `aria-live` region baked in
- `aurora-spotlight` — the cursor-tracking interior glow + 1px border beam from
  auroralib.com's feature grid, as a wrapper for any card; layers inherit the host's
  border-radius; themed via `--aurora-spotlight-*`
- `aurora-dock` — children magnify as the cursor approaches, macOS-dock style:
  `max`, `range`, `lift`
- `aurora-ripple` — a soft pointer ripple on press, clipped to the host's radius:
  `--aurora-ripple-color`

## 0.7.0

Imagery batch.

- `aurora-lens` — an image that liquifies toward the cursor with a chromatic-aberration
  fringe, rendered by a tiny raw-WebGL shader over a real `<img>` (so accessibility,
  SEO and no-WebGL environments keep the plain image): `src`, `alt`, `strength`,
  `crossorigin`; GPU work defers until visible and rebuilds on context restore
- `aurora-wave` (`aurora/three`) — a wireframe ocean plane displaced by travelling
  sine waves: `color`, `speed`, `amplitude`, `opacity`

## 0.6.0

Accessibility pass.

- All components attach their shadow root with `delegatesFocus`, so `host.focus()`
  reaches the first focusable shadow element and components behave like native controls
- `aurora-tabs` implements the WAI-ARIA tabs keyboard pattern: Arrow keys move and
  select, Home/End jump, and the tab bar keeps a roving tabindex
- `aurora-modal` now moves focus into the dialog on open (first focusable, falling
  back to the panel), traps Tab / Shift+Tab while open, and restores focus to the
  opener on close

## 0.5.0

Text motion batch.

- `aurora-text` now reveals on scroll into view (previously on mount — content already
  in view still animates immediately) and gains `by="chars"` for a per-character rise
  inside word masks, like a display headline; emits `aurora-complete`
- `aurora-scramble` — decodes text through a run of random glyphs, left to right, on
  scroll into view; `hover` replays on pointer enter; `duration`, `chars`, `play()`
- `aurora-typewriter` — types text behind a blinking accent caret on scroll into view;
  `speed` (chars/s), `delay`, `no-caret`, `start()`

## 0.4.0

Motion & visuals batch — the aurorae from [auroralib.com](https://auroralib.com) as components.

- `aurora-nebula` — animated aurora-borealis backdrop as a tiny raw-WebGL fragment shader
  (~2 kB, no 3D library): `color`/`color2`/`color3`, `speed`, `glow`, `still`; DPR capped at 2,
  pauses off-screen and in hidden tabs, still frame under `prefers-reduced-motion`
- `aurora-reveal` — scroll-into-view fade/rise for any content, optional `stagger` for children
  (IntersectionObserver, no scroll listeners)
- `aurora-counter` — count-up number on scroll into view; re-tweens when `value` changes;
  `from`, `duration`, `decimals`; emits `aurora-complete`
- `aurora-cursor` — trailing cursor glow ring that grows over interactive elements; fine
  pointers only, never hides the system cursor; themed via `--aurora-cursor-*`
- `aurora-particles` (`aurora/three`) — drifting GPU particle field with additive glow,
  two-tone gradient and pointer parallax: `count`, `color`, `color2`, `size`, `speed`
- new `whenVisible` helper exported from the package root

## 0.3.0

Forms batch — all three are form-associated via `ElementInternals`, so they submit
natively with a surrounding `<form>`.

- `aurora-input` — text field with an animated focus underline; re-emits `input` / `change`
- `aurora-switch` — animated toggle with `role="switch"`; submits `value` (default `on`) when checked
- `aurora-slider` — draggable, keyboard-accessible range slider; emits `input` while sliding, `change` on release

## 0.2.0

Overlays batch.

- `aurora-modal` — animated dialog with backdrop, Escape / backdrop-click to close, `open` attribute and `show()` / `hide()` methods, `aurora-open` / `aurora-close` events
- `aurora-tooltip` — hover/focus tooltip with `text` and `position` (top/bottom/left/right)
- `aurora-accordion` — collapsible panel with animated height
- `aurora-tabs` + `aurora-tab-panel` — tabbed interface with an animated active indicator, `aurora-tab-change` event
- Shared `escapeHtml` helper is now exported from the package root

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- Framework-agnostic Web Components with self-contained Shadow DOM styling
- Core components (GSAP): `aurora-button`, `aurora-magnetic`, `aurora-text`, `aurora-marquee`, `aurora-tilt`
- 3D component (Three.js): `aurora-scene`, on the `aurora/three` entry so Three.js is opt-in
- CSS-variable theming, `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- ESM + CJS + type declarations via tsup; Vitest (happy-dom) tests; CI
